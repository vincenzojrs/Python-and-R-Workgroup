# API project
API, or Application Programming Interfaces, are the interfaces provided by servers that you can use to retrieve and send third-party data using code. \
API: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#section/Studio-Ghibli-API

# Objective:
Data collection by accessing the API from https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/#section/Studio-Ghibli-API.

#Info about the API:
Studio Ghibli is a Japanese animation film studio. Their APIs provides information about the film theyâ€™ve produced until 2016.
To access each APIs we used the following link: https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com followed by 5 endpoints, one for each API: /films, /people, /species, /vehicles and /location.
Each APIs has different variables.

# Our purpose
Our purpose was to make the code simple, readable, and the leanest possible, mainly using for cycles. 
To achieve the same result for different objects (like drawing graphs) we provided different approaches.

# Code Explanation
The complete explanation of the code is available here: [Documentation](https://github.com/vincenzojrs/Python-and-R-Workgroup---Task-1-and-Task-2.1/blob/main/Documentation%20Ghibli%20Project%20Task%201.pdf)
